# SuperTag

After searching for a way to resolve lighthearted disagreements with my girlfriend (about who does the washing up mainly!), I decided it would be the perfect time work on my OOP skills. After some research, I concluded creating a game using pygame would kill two birds with one stone. SuperTag is a simple two-player game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game is called "SuperTag," where players try to tag each other within a time limit. The player with the most time remaining at the end of the game wins.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the Pygame library:

   ```bash
   pip3 install pygame
   ```

3. Download the game files and images.

## How to Play

- Run the game script by executing the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```

- Player One and Player Two compete to tag each other.
- The game displays the time remaining for each player.
- Press the spacebar to restart the game when it ends.
- Enjoy the game!

## Files

- `main.py`: Main game logic and initialization.
- `settings.py`: Game settings and constants.
- `level.py`: Level class handling the game mechanics.
- `player.py`: Player class defining player attributes and actions.
- 'window.py': Sets the game terrain
